/**
 * Marks a method or field as a producer for bean instances. Producer methods are essentially bean factories, while
 * producer fields are bean factories that only depend on its containing bean state. This annotation works similarly
 * to the {@code @Produces} annotation in CDI or the {@code @Bean} annotation in Spring.
 * There are a few rules related to producers:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Producer methods must be non-abstract methods of a bean class (static or not).</li>
 *     <li>Producer fields must be from a bean class.</li>
 *     <li>If the bean class's scope is different from the produced bean, then it must be a larger scope.</li>
 *     <li>If producer methods return a nullable value, then it must be {@link DependentScoped}.</li>
 *     <li>Producer method return type and producer field type must not be a type variable.</li>
 *     <li>Producer method return type and producer field type may be parameterized only if it specifies actual types
 *     or a type variable for each parameter, the latter case also required to be {@link DependentScoped}.</li>
 *     <li>Beans may declare multiple producer methods and fields.</li>
 *     <li>Producers are <em>not inherited</em> by subclasses.</li>
 * </ul>
