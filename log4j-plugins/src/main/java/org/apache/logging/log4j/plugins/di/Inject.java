/**
 * Marks a constructor, field, or method for dependency injection. Constructors are injected first, followed by fields,
 * then methods. Superclasses are injected before subclasses. Note that zero-arg methods with this annotation are
 * considered initialization methods which are also invoked during dependency injection.
 *
 * <h2>Constructors</h2>
 * A class can have at most one constructor annotated with {@code @Inject}. This constructor can have zero or more
 * dependencies as arguments. If a class has no constructors annotated with {@code @Inject}, then its default
 * zero args constructor is used if available.
 *
 * <h2>Fields</h2>
 * Both static and non-static fields may be annotated with {@code @Inject}. These fields must not be final.
 *
 * <h2>Methods</h2>
 * Non-abstract methods (both static and non-static) may be annotated with {@code @Inject}. These methods must not
 * declare any type parameters of their own, take zero or more dependencies as arguments, and may return a value which
 * is ignored (e.g., for builder method chaining).
