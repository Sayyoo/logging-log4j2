/**
 * Marks a parameter of a method to be used for disposing a {@linkplain Produces produced instance}. A disposer method
 * more generally is a non-abstract method in a bean class with one argument annotated with {@code @Disposes} to indicate
 * the injection point for the produced bean for disposal along with any other normal injectable parameters if desired.
 * A bean can have more than one disposer method, but each disposer method can only dispose of one produced type.
 * Disposer methods can be static or non-static. Disposer methods are <em>not inherited</em> by subclasses.
